            You leapt from crumbling bridges
Watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing
In the ocean from way above
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers
Wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos
Left in the dark
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Your lips, my lips
Apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers
Flood is rising up on your knees
Oh, please
Come out and haunt me
I know you want me
Come out and haunt me
Sharing all your secrets with each other
Since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you
Clutched in your fist
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
Got the music in you, baby
Tell me why
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever
And you just can't say goodbye
Ooh, oh
When you're all alone
I'll reach for you
When you're feelin' low
I'll be there too
